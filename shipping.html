            <h4><em>★ My tracking says my order was delivered, but I haven’t gotten it yet. Where is it?</em></h4>
                <p>Some carriers will mark a package as delivered before they actually deliver it. Though unusual, this can happen up to 5 days before an item is actually delivered. You can try contacting the carrier to get better insight into the delay. If you still haven’t received your package after 5 days, and you’ve checked with your neighbors and still don’t have it, please reach out to us at (507)-398-4729 and we’ll do our best to help!</h5>
         
                    <h4><em>★ I received notification my order was shipped but I still have not received it and my tracking info does not indicate the package was delivered.</em></h4>
                    <p>If your shipment tracking link for your order has not been updated beyond the “pre-shipment” or “label created” stage in 2 weeks, please contact us so we can look into it for you.
                        You have up to 30 days from the date of shipment to claim your package as lost in order to receive a reshipment if stock permits or refund for your missing item(s).</h5>

                        <h4><em>★ What do I need to know about customs fees?</em></h4>
                <p>Depending on your country, you may be charged customs/import fees. Customs charges and fees are the sole responsibility of the purchaser; we are not responsible for any additional customs charges or fees once your package has left our facility.</h5>

                    <h4><em>★ When will I get tracking information?</em></h4>
                <p>Tracking information will be sent via e-mail once your package is processed for shipment. Make sure to check all inboxes, including your spam folder, if you can’t find your shipping confirmation. 
                    Please note it can take up to 3 days for your initial tracking information status to update.</h5>

                    <h4><em>★ My item was shipped, but still hasn’t shown up. Is it lost in the mail?</em></h4>
                <p>PYou have up to 30 days from the date of shipment to claim your package as lost in order to receive a reshipment if stock permits or a refund for your missing item(s).
