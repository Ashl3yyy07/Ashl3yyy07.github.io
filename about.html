            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p><strong><em>STAGE FRIGHT</em></strong> is an upcoming rock band formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2022. The members, Sonya, Dawson, Zianna, and Brantly, all met during college. Long-time friends Sonya and Dawson are the two main founding members of Stage Fright. During their college years, Sonya and Dawson’s love for music decided to perform at gigs together. They would do this any chance they could in small clubs, diners, and festivals. Over time, they began to gain traction around their area. They finally welcomed the last two other members, Zianna and Brantly, shortly after their forming and increasing popularity. The band debuted as a four-member band, finally taking the name of Stage Fright. People around America began to notice the small band's music and grew a fascination with them through their social media presence. Seeing their success, they announced the Spotlight Tour after finishing their first full-length record. Through their experimental sound, they were quickly able to make a name for themselves in the world of rock.</p>

                <h2>★ Sonya Hidalgo ★</h4>
                <p>Sonya is the lead singer and founder of the rock band Stage Fright along with Dawson. She loved singing ever since she was a kid, and her passion only grew stronger. At 21 years old, she took a leap and dropped out of college to pursue her dream: to perform for the world. She grew up in the same neighborhood as Dawson and they attended the same university, during which they both actively worked to improve their abilities. She sang at gigs during college on her own and made a name for herself before partnering with Dawson and forming the band.</p>

                <h2>★ Dawson Reed ★</h4>
                <p>Dawson is the bassist and backup singer of the group. He grew up in Minneapolis with Sonya in a suburban neighborhood, where they would often listen to rock music together. He first learned to play the guitar before picking up the bass, but now much prefers his current instrument. He got his bachelor's in music, being the only member who finished their college career. Due to his profound knowledge of music theory, he plays a leading role in writing and producing their songs.</p>

                <h2>★ Zianna Brooks ★</h4>
                <p>Zianna is the electric guitarist of the band and grew up in Chicago in a small community with very few friends. She wanted to start anew, which is why she moved to Minneapolis to start her new life in college. She grew up with many relatives who played instruments, which was what inspired her to pick up the guitar. While in college she met Sonya, Dawson, and Brantly, and they became best friends due to their similar interests. She chose to drop out of college to pursue her dream with the rest of the members.

                <p>Brantly is the drummer of the band who grew up in the Wisconsin countryside. Unlike the other members, his passion for music started during college after meeting the others. He would then go to many rock concerts and gigs, where he would always be amazed by the drummer’s sense of rhythm. He then went on to take professional drumming lessons and practice as much as his studies would allow. Years later, got enough confidence and experience to join Stage Fright.</p>
